Example training data:
{insert sky pics here}

Example results:
{insert generated sky pics here}

- Training images scraped from [r/SkyPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyporn/) using Pushshift
- Trained and deployed on local CPU (code for training on AWS Sagemaker included)
- Some GAN code used from [bvshyam/facegeneration_gan_sagemaker](https://github.com/bvshyam/facegeneration_gan_sagemaker) and [vjrahil/Face-Generator](https://github.com/vjrahil/Face-Generator/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb)
