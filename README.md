Example results:
{insert generated sky pics here}

- Training images scraped from [r/SkyPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyporn/) using Reddit API (see sky-collector.py)
- Trained using AWS Sagemaker compute power
- Some GAN code used from [bvshyam/facegeneration_gan_sagemaker](https://github.com/bvshyam/facegeneration_gan_sagemaker) and [vjrahil/Face-Generator](https://github.com/vjrahil/Face-Generator/blob/master/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb)
